AI-powered Intrusion Detection System using Suricata and Machine Learning


# AI-Powered Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

This project builds a machine learning-based intrusion detection system (IDS) using Suricata-generated network alert logs. It applies classification models to detect and categorize suspicious activity in real-world network data.

## 🔍 Features

- Uses Suricata's `alerts-only.json` format
- Parses IPs, ports, protocols, TCP flags, HTTP fields
- Trains both RandomForest and XGBoost classifiers
- Handles large-scale JSON logs with filtering, downsampling, and encoding
- Scripts for training, inference, and evaluation

## 🧪 Model Evaluation

Coming soon: accuracy, confusion matrix, precision/recall, etc.
